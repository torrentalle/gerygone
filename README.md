With Gerygone, you can write YAML tests for checking your cloud infrastructure is configured correctly.
It's planned to provide support for multiple cloud providers but in the initial stage only [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) is supported.

Gerygone tests your actual infrastructure state by executing API calls. So you can use any Infrastructure as Code tool, Terraform, CloudFormation, Heat, Azure Templates and so on.
